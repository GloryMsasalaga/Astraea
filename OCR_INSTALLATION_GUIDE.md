# Tesseract OCR Engine Installation Instructions for Windows

## Current Status
âœ… **Python OCR Libraries Installed Successfully:**
- PyPDF2==3.0.1 (for PDF text extraction)
- PyMuPDF==1.26.3 (for advanced PDF processing)
- Pillow==10.1.0 (for image processing)
- pytesseract==0.3.10 (Python wrapper for Tesseract)

## Missing Component: Tesseract OCR Engine

The Python libraries are installed, but the actual Tesseract OCR engine needs to be installed separately on Windows.

### Option 1: Download and Install Tesseract OCR (Recommended)

1. **Download Tesseract OCR for Windows:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - Download the latest Windows installer (tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.x.x.exe)

2. **Install Tesseract:**
   - Run the installer as Administrator
   - Choose installation directory (default: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR)
   - Make sure to select "Add to PATH" during installation

3. **Verify Installation:**
   ```cmd
   tesseract --version
   ```

4. **Configure pytesseract (if needed):**
   If Tesseract is not in PATH, add this to your Django settings:
   ```python
   import pytesseract
   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
   ```

### Option 2: Alternative OCR Solutions

If you prefer not to install Tesseract, you can:

1. **Use Google Cloud Vision API** (already in requirements.txt)
2. **Use Azure Computer Vision API**
3. **Use AWS Textract**

### Current Functionality

Even without Tesseract, your system will work because:

1. **PDF Text Extraction:** PyPDF2 and PyMuPDF can extract text from text-based PDFs
2. **Graceful Fallbacks:** The code handles missing OCR gracefully
3. **Error Handling:** Proper logging and placeholder text when OCR fails

### Testing OCR After Installation

After installing Tesseract, you can test it with:

```bash
python manage.py test_ocr
```

Or create a test document and process it through the system.

### Production Deployment Notes

For production deployment, consider:
- Using cloud-based OCR services for better scalability
- Installing Tesseract on your server
- Using Docker containers with pre-installed OCR engines
